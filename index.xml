In this post, we are going to look a bit harder at the issue in the hope of coming up with actionable items.
Where are we now ‚Äì a simplified responsibility matrix The less-than-ideal situation in which many technology products find themselves is due to the insufficient coordination between marketing teams and technology teams. With the rise of customer-centric methodology, what had worked before needs adjustment.</description></item><item><title>Explore Goodreads data: my most read authors</title><link>https://azure562.github.io/blog/goodreads-python-data/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 10:13:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://azure562.github.io/blog/goodreads-python-data/</guid><description>Photo by Nubia Navarro (nubikini) from Pexels

My previous post ended with a question: how to build a cohesive product experience with the different types of writings: copywriting, technical writing, and UX writing? This is a topic I&amp;rsquo;ve been pondering time and again. Here is the recent thought.
Global trends and technology buying research Let&amp;rsquo;s start with some observations of today&amp;rsquo;s high-tech industry.
From project management&amp;rsquo;s point of view, the Project Management Institute (PMI)&amp;rsquo;s PMBOK¬Æ Guide believes there are three global trends that are disrupting traditional business models and transforming products and services:</description></item><item><title>A brief discussion: Copywriting, Technical writing, UX writing, and product experience</title><link>https://azure562.github.io/blog/copy-tech-ux-writing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 13:23:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://azure562.github.io/blog/copy-tech-ux-writing/</guid><description>Photo by fauxels from Pexels
Have you ever wondered about the various types of writings, or what exactly that guy/gal with a title of ‚Äúsome writer‚Äù is doing?
Traditionally in the job market there are two categories of writing positions: copywriting and technical writing. Not long ago there entered a new one: UX writing. But what‚Äôs the difference? And what is the implication to the profession of writing and to the business world in general?</description></item><item><title>How to Write (and rewrite) - Part II</title><link>https://azure562.github.io/blog/how-to-write-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 09:06:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azure562.github.io/blog/how-to-write-2/</guid><description>A peculiar challenge of technical communication is to convey complex information without confusing the audience. But what is complex?
Merriam-Webster defines complex as &amp;ldquo;a group of things that are connected in complicated ways&amp;rdquo;. In other words, complex is the result of the (difficult to analyze, understand, or explain) ways things relate to each other.
So, if we can figure out how to make the ways things relate to each other easy to understand, would that solve the problem of conveying complex information?</description></item><item><title>How to Write (and I know you know) - Part I</title><link>https://azure562.github.io/blog/how-to-write-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 20:38:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azure562.github.io/blog/how-to-write-1/</guid><description>Photo by Ketut Subiyanto from Pexels
If you have established your credibility as a technical writer or communicator, it‚Äôs only natural that people come to you for advice on writing.
Though almost every profession has to deal with some writing tasks, most of the time a well-defined template could guarantee a decent output.
Chances are, those who come to you are not asking for a template. If they are not committed to becoming a tech writer, what advice would you give, advice that is generic enough while still focus on technical aspects (a knowledge-sharing topic, a how-to guide, or a draft for a section in tech docs)?</description></item><item><title>Lean Writer</title><link>https://azure562.github.io/blog/lean-writer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 19:58:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azure562.github.io/blog/lean-writer/</guid><description>How does a tech writer create value in the customer-centric era?

Still optimizing for editorial skill? Though the job title of Tech Writer is nothing new, the scope of a tech writer‚Äôs work is never clear-cut.
Traditionally, tech writers are responsible for:
editing the drafts provided by developers applying some editorial styles publishing the final user documentation Such a perspective puts tech writers at the downstream of product development and leads to the practice of allocating one tech writer to multiple projects (often across different products).</description></item><item><title>Google Analytics for Tech Docs</title><link>https://azure562.github.io/blog/ga-for-doc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 19:24:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azure562.github.io/blog/ga-for-doc/</guid><description>You might have heard about the build-measure-learn feedback loop, a core component of the Lean Startup ü¶Ñ methodology.

Set up another repository for the GitHub page, which will host your generated website.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://azure562.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 20:10:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azure562.github.io/about/</guid><description>In 2015, Merriam-Webster named the suffix -ism Word of the Year. Well, the prefix -re deserves no less&amp;hellip;
Rethink, reinvent, rebuild, repurpose, are just a few that came to mind. Not to mention the universal desire to reconnect in the post-pandemic world.
But, what does that have to do with this retold?
Humans learn through stories. While what actually matters is the story we tell ourselves.
We all know that the same story could be interpreted differently by different people.</description></item><item><title>Reference Information</title><link>https://azure562.github.io/blog/reference-info/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 20:01:11 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azure562.github.io/blog/reference-info/</guid><description>Here are some resources that I find useful.
